# UFOs
`Module 11: Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.`

## Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Data: index.html, app.js, data.js, style.css

## Overview of Project

I am utilizing a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a webpage that displays data concerning various UFO sightings around the world. This past week I have learned how to create a table which is stored as a JavaScript array with the ability to filter data based upon certain criteria. With this skill under my belt, this weeks challenge askes me to provide a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings, through the use of additional filters and the ability to utilize multiple filters at the same time on the webpage. Therefore, in addition to already having a filter based around date, I will adding the ability to filter the table of UFO sightings with a city, state, country and shape.

## Results

This weeks module consists of the following two deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

### Unfiltered Webpage

<img width="1436" alt="Web Page Bottom (Unfiltered)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95828604/156710681-4e10ef18-401f-4781-9086-b648300b2bf9.png">

- The entirety of my created webpage is seen above. The provided image serves as an example of the data table unfiltered. There are suggestions of possible inputs but none have been commited as of yet. 

### Suggested Filters

- Now a filter has been applied across all criteria. In this image, I have applied the suggested inputs as seen in the first image. 

### Other Filters
<img width="1427" alt="Web Page (Filtered 2)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95828604/156711604-fc4fe461-4c37-4e4c-bed4-e85f35852778.png">

- As seen above, a different set of criteria has been used. This serves to show that the webpage is capable of a plethora of searches. 

### Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md) (AS SEEN HERE)
