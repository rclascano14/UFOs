# UFOs
`Module 11: Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.`

## Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Data: index.html, app.js, data.js, style.css

## Overview of Project

I am utilizing a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a webpage that displays data concerning various UFO sightings around the world. This past week I have learned how to create a table which is stored as a JavaScript array with the ability to filter data based upon certain criteria. With this skill under my belt, this weeks challenge askes me to provide a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings, through the use of additional filters and the ability to utilize multiple filters at the same time on the webpage. Therefore, in addition to already having a filter based around date, I will adding the ability to filter the table of UFO sightings with a city, state, country and shape.

## Results

This weeks module consists of the following two deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

### Unfiltered Webpage

<img width="1436" alt="Web Page Bottom (Unfiltered)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95828604/156710681-4e10ef18-401f-4781-9086-b648300b2bf9.png">

- The entirety of my created webpage is seen above. The provided image serves as an example of the data table unfiltered. There are suggestions of possible inputs but none have been commited as of yet. 

### Suggested Filters

- Now a filter has been applied across all criteria. In this image, I have applied the suggested inputs as seen in the first image. 

### Other Filters

- As seen above, a different set of criteria has been used. This serves to show that the webpage is capable of a plethora of searches. 

### Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md) (AS SEEN HERE)

## Summary

### Drawbacks

A potential drawback of the designed web page is the limitations of the filters. For example, the search criteria is case sensitive just as JavaScript itself is. Were someone to look up El Cajon under the city filter, no results would be found, as opposed to five results being found under el cajon. In addition, if someone were to place a space at the end of their search, they would garner no results. The webpage is also linked to a static dataset of solely the United States, meaning that the webpage will not be updated as more UFO sightings are made across the world. Therefore, the web page is prone to human error due to its limitations. 

### Recommendations

(1) There is the possibility that an individual may have a limited recollection or access to the specifics of their search. To remedy this, I could expand the functions of the filters to allow for a range of numbers, states, countries, etc. For example, if someone was looking for a particular UFO sighting but they only knew the month that it took place. Expanding the filter to a range would allow for this individual to see all UFO sightings within a specific month. 
(2) If the webpage was linked to a more functional dataset that adjusted to new sightings from around the world, this webpage would be far more pertinent towards studies on UFOs and become more accessible to the general public.
